# OpenGL Python Graphics Seminar

Welcome to the OpenGL Python Graphics Seminar repository! This project is designed for advanced computer graphics seminars, providing a curated set of hands-on exercises and code samples to master graphics programming concepts using Python and OpenGL (PyOpenGL).

## Overview

This repository serves as a practical guide for students and professionals aiming to deepen their understanding of computer graphics. Each exercise is crafted to build foundational and advanced skills, covering topics such as rendering pipelines, transformations, shaders, lighting, and interactive graphics applications.

## Repository Structure

- **Examples/**: Contains all seminar exercises as Jupyter notebooks, named using the format `n.Name.ipynb` (e.g., `01.Introduction.ipynb`, `02.Transformations.ipynb`). Each notebook is self-contained, with explanations, code, and visual outputs.
- **LICENSE**: Project license information.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pyopengl jupyter
```

### Running the Exercises

1. Clone this repository:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Opengl-Python-Graphics-Seminar.git
	```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
	```bash
	cd Opengl-Python-Graphics-Seminar
	```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
	```bash
	jupyter notebook Examples/
	```
4. Open any notebook and follow the instructions to run and modify the code.

## Exercise Naming Convention

All exercises are named using the format `n.Name.ipynb`, where:
- `n` is the two-digit practice number (e.g., `01`, `02`, ...)
- `Name` is a short, descriptive title for the exercise

This ensures clarity and easy navigation as the seminar progresses.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to expand and improve the seminar materials! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Add your exercise notebook to the `Examples/` folder, following the naming convention
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes
